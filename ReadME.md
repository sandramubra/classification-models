# Project: MLclassifiers
MLclassifiers.ipynb is an python notebook written with the purpose 
of classifying samples of distinct types based on RNA-Seq data.


## Installation
Python 3 and the following packages should be installed:
jupyter, numpy, pandas, sklearn, keras, seaborn, and matplotlib.


## Usage
This notebook uses the dataset 'data_for_ML_project.csv'
(it was sent to the course instructor's email on 12-02-2020).
Place it in the same folder as the python notebook. 

Although the data is not open, the code can be used for any dataset 
with the following structure:
- Samples as rows
- Genes as columns
- Targets in a column named 'Types'
